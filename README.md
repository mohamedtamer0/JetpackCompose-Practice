## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/JetpackCompose-Practice.git
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    - Launch Android Studio.
    - Select "Open" and navigate to the cloned directory (specifically `BlurEffectApp` if it's the root project you want to run, but usually opening the root repo works if configured as a multi-module, though here it seems `BlurEffectApp` is a standalone project folder).
    - *Note based on folder structure*: The actual Android project is located inside `BlurEffectApp`. Open that folder in Android Studio.

3.  **Build and Run:**
    - Let Gradle sync complete.
    - Select a device or emulator.
    - Click the "Run" button (green play icon).
